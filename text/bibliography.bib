This bug (now fixed) allowed bypassing the balancing countermeasures against timing attacks deployed in the implementation of the MAC-then-Encode-then-CBC-Encrypt (MEE-CBC) component, creating a timing side-channel similar to that exploited by Lucky 13.",

    abstract="This paper describes a timing attack on the RC5 block encryption algorithm. The analysis is motivated by the possibility that some implementations of RC5 could result in the data-dependent rotations taking a time that is a function of the data. Assuming that encryption timing measurements can be made which enable the cryptanalyst to deduce the total amount of rotations carried out during an encryption, it is shown that, for the nominal version of RC5, only a few thousand ciphertexts are required to determine 5 bits of the last half-round subkey with high probability. Further, it is shown that it is practical to determine the whole secret key with about 220 encryption timings with a time complexity that can be as low as 228.",

  abstract = {High-performance cryptographic code often relies on complex hand-tuned assembly language that is customized for individual hardware platforms. Such code is difficult to understand or analyze. We introduce a new programming language and tool called Vale that supports flexible, automated verification of high-performance assembly code. The Vale tool transforms annotated assembly language into an abstract syntax tree (AST), while also generating proofs about the AST that are verified via an SMT solver. Since the AST is a first-class proof term, it can be further analyzed and manipulated by proven-correct code before being extracted into standard assembly. For example, we have developed a novel, proven-correct taint-analysis engine that verifies the code's freedom from digital side channels. Using these tools, we verify the correctness, safety, and security of implementations of SHA-256 on x86 and ARM, Poly1305 on x64, and hardware-accelerated AES-CBC on x86. Several implementations meet or beat the performance of unverified, state-of-the-art cryptographic libraries.},
