\chapter{Introduction}

Overview of the context, current problems and difficulties, discussion 
of current solutions, our solution and its short evaluation.


\section{Overview of the chapters}


\chapter{Analysis}

In this chapter we look at lightweightedness in cryptography, consider 
fundamental properties of reversibility, analyze properties of our 
solution{ and define terminology}.

\section{Terminology}

directly reversible = an injective function


\chapter{Design}

This chapter defines the inputs and outputs for crypto algorithms, 
expected behaviour and goals and finally methods of evaluating those 
properties. 

+ use translation to other language for verification (e.g. Vale)

\chapter{Implementation}

Here we show our implementations, prove their correctness and discuss them.

\chapter{Evaluation}

\section{design}
\section{implementations}
\section{experiments/testing}

\chapter{Reflections}

Evaluation of our solution in a broader context, usability in practice 
and viability of real-world implementation

\chapter{Related Work}

obvious

\chapter{Conclusion}

Discussion of results.
